  Main code is  

       Fastbus_main1.C

  Support code is all the other *.C and *.h files

  To compile type "make"

  To run, you'll need a link to an existing data file.  

         ln -s ~/scratch/happexsp/happexsp_6742.dat.0 run.dat

  Then run the executible

         ./fbana 10000

         The argument here (10000) is the number of events.
         If you leave that out, there is a default.

  The output is a root file with some histograms.  

         sbs.root

  If you turn on the "debug" flag in the main code, it will
  produce a bunch of output.
