      <h3 align=center>WebTerm Terminal Emulator and Telnet Client</h3>
      <h2 align=center>Implementation Details</h2>
      <hr>

      <p>Java classes that implement a low-level terminal screen handler, a
      VT200/XTerm/VT100/VT52 terminal emulator, and a Telnet session
      client.  These can be used together to form a complete TELNET
      applet.</p>

      <h3>Parameters</h3>

      <p>The "WebTerm.class" applet recognizes the following
	parameters:</p>
      <dl>
	<dt> HOST
	<dd> <p>Name of initial host machine.  If not supplied, it is the
	    machine the applet was retrieved from.</p>
	<dt> PORT
	<dd> <p>Number of port for connection.  If not suppled, it is 23,
	    the standard Telnet port.</p>
	<dt> FONTSIZE
	<dd> <p>Point size of font to use as terminal's screen text.  If
	    not supplied, it is the size if the default Component font.</p>
	<dt> REGISTER
	<dd> <p>Name to under which to register the terminal, in a
	    <a href="http://www.cs.orst.edu/~hackbod/java/ClassRegistry/">
	      class registry</a>.  By sending a 
	    "<code>send</code>" command to a WebTerm applet through this
	    registry, other applets can insert data into the terminal's
	    input stream as if the user had directly typed it.</p>
	<dt> PROMPT#, REPLY#, ENDPROMPTS#
	<dd> <p>A set of parameters for specifying automatic replies to
	    incoming text.  The '#' represents the prompt number -- prompts
	    should start at 1, and be consecutively numbered.  'PROMPT' is
	    the trigger text, 'REPLY' is the text to send when the trigger
	    is encountered, and if 'ENDPROMPTS' is true then this will turn
	    off <em>all</em> prompts for the rest of the telnet
	    session.</p> <p>The supplied strings may contain standard Java
	    escape sequences, including \n, \r, \t, \b, \f, \###, \u####,
	    and \x##.</p>
	<dt> FOREGROUND and BACKGROUND
	<dd> <p>Set the foreground and background colors, respectively, of
	    the terminal.  May be a standard Java color string or the word
	    "default" for the system default colors; if not supplied, uses
	    a black on light grey combination.</p>
	<dt> HISTORY
	<dd> <p>Set the number of lines in the history buffer.  A value of
	    zero means no history buffer, though this doesn't yet keep the
	    scrollbar from being displayed.  Note that each line in the
	    buffer takes (6*cols) bytes, so be careful with how large you
	    make it!</p>
      </dl>

      <h3>Features not yet implemented</h3>

      <ul>
	<li> There is no cut-and-paste mechanism.
	<li> Resizing of the terminal is not well supported.
	<li> Ability to turn the applet into a just button that, when
	  pressed, starts the terminal in its own window.
      </ul>

      <h3>Java classes</h3>

      <dl>
	<dt> <code>WebTerm</code>
	<dd> <p>A full applet, which combines the below classes to provide
	    an actual VT100 terminal emulator.  It includes controls to
	    select a host and port, opening and closing the network
	    connection, bringing up an options window, and the actual
	    terminal screen and scrollbar.</p>

	<dt> <code>Telnet</code>
	<dd> <p>Implements a complete Telnet session client.  As far as we
	    know, this client implements the
	    <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?number=854">
	      Telnet protocol</a>
	    correctly, though fairly minimally; it supports the
	    <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?number=855">
	      standard Telnet options</a>
	    <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?number=1091">
	      <code>TERMINAL TYPE</code></a>
	    and
	    <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?number=1073">
	      <code>NAWS</code></a>
	    (the latter is used to communicate the terminal dimensions to
	    the server), and partially supports
	    <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?856">
	      <code>BINARY</code></a>,
	    <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?1079">
	      <code>TERMINAL-SPEED</code></a>,
	      and
	    <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?654">
	      <code>NAOHTD</code></a>.
	    When connecting to a server, it always tries to turn
	    on the server's
	    <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?number=857">
	      <code>ECHO</code></a>
	    option; if the server refuses, it echos characters back
	    locally.  This implementation was based on the
	    <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?number=1780">
	      March 1995 protocol standards</a>.</p>

	  <p>The Telnet client communicates with the user through an
	    instance of an <code>Emulator</code> class, from which it also
	    receives information about the emulation name and terminal
	    dimensions.</p> <p>It also defines a private class, named
	    <code>PromptInfo</code>.  An instance of this class is made for
	    each prompt argument, and is used to the state information
	    needed to watch for that prompt.</p>
       
	<dt> <code>Emulator</code>
	<dd> <p>A generic base class for terminal emulations; this
	    implements a set of methods that the terminal uses to send data
	    to the Telnet session, and that the Telnet session uses to send
	    data to the terminal.</p>

	<dt> <code>EmulatorOptions</code>
	<dd> <p>The emulation options control window, created by the
	    "Options..." button.  Allows the user to dynamically load
	    emulators and set their emulation type.</p>

	<dt> <code>VT200</code>
	<dd> <p>A subclass of the Emulator that implements VT200, VT100,
	    VT52, and XTerm control
	    sequences.  The following sequences are currently
	    implemented:</p>
       <pre>

</pre>
	  <p>This implements the basic VT220 control sequences.  The major
	    missing functionality is: character set control, selective
	    erase, user defined keys, and down-line loaded characters.  It
	    also does not yet report all of the important key and mouse
	    events.</p>

	<dt> <code>RubberTextField</code>
	<dd> <p>A variation on the standard TextField that allows more
	    control over its size and layout.</p>

	<dt> <code>Terminal</code>
	<dd> <p>The basic functionality of an ASCII terminal.  Implements
	    functions for writing text to the terminal, moving the cursor,
	    scrolling regions of the screen, insert and deleting lines, and
	    history.
	    The class has a small amount of smarts for optimizing
	    redrawing, but could use quite a bit more.</p>

      </dl>

      <h3>Implementation interfaces</h3>

      <dl>
	<dt> <code>Parameters</code>
	<dd> <p>An interface used to hand the applet parameters to the
	    Telnet and Terminal classes.</p>
