<h3 align=center>WebTerm Terminal Emulator and Telnet Client</h3>
<h2 align=center>Version History</h2>
<hr>

      <h3>Known Bugs</h3>

      <ul>
	<li> Inserting a character into the middle of text in emacs moves
	  the right side of the line two columns to the right instead of
	  one.
      </ul>

      <h3>Changes in v2.0:</h3>
      <dl>
	<dt> <strong>Bug fixes</strong>
	<dd>
	  <ul>
	    <li> Completely rewrote VT100 escape sequence parser; it is now
	      much more ANSI-compliant and robust.
	    <li> Fixed many race conditions in Terminal and Telnet
	      classes.
	    <li> Telnet now uses a DataOutputStream for writing to its
	      socket; directly writing to the socket's stream wasn't
	      working on the Mac.
	    <li> Wasn't catching exceptions when attempting to create
	      fonts.
	  </ul>
	<dt> <strong>New features</strong>
	<dd>
	  <ul>
	    <li> New "Options" window and button, allows dynamic loading
	      and selection of emulators.
	    <li> Added scrollable session mechanism to terminal.
	    <li> Added basic color support to terminal.
	    <li> New terminal modes: smooth scroll (well, not
	      <em>really</em> that smooth), newline-does-CR, no wrapping,
	      and inverse.
	    <li> Slight optimizations to display rendering: keeps track of
	      which lines have changed.
	    <li> Added VT200 and VT52 emulation; expanded the XTerm and
	      VT100 emulations, and changed the class's name to "VT200".
	      Many many new control sequences are supported.
	    <li> Telnet keeps track of both local and server options.
	    <li> Telnet now allows the
	      <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?856">BINARY</a>,
	      <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?1079">TERMINAL-SPEED</a>,
	      and
	      <a href="http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/view?654">NAOHTD</a>
	      options, but this isn't yet very well supported.
	    <li> Now locally echos characters back the terminal when the
	      TELNET server refuses to go into ECHO mode.
	    <li> Lots of general code clean-up and documentation.
	  </ul>
      </dl>

      <h3>Changes in v1.3:</h3>
      <dl>
	<dt> <strong>Bug fixes</strong>
	<dd>
	  <ul>
	    <li> Thread.setDaemon() is an insecure method in Netscape 3.0,
	      causing the applet to crash when connecting.  It is no longer
	      called.
	    <li> Now correctly handles smaller applet sizes.
	    <li> Slight fixes to VT100 emulation.
	    <li> The Telnet class now correctly handles multiple names from an
	      emulation.
	    <li> Cleaned up source: split into multiple files.
	  </ul>
	<dt> <strong>New features</strong>
	<dd>
	  <ul>
	    <li> Added REGISTRY and FONTSIZE parameters.
	    <li> Registers itself with a ClassRegistry, so that other
	      applets can insert text into its input stream with
	      a "send" command.
	    <li> Cleaned up font allocation, now handles bold and italic
	      fonts.
	    <li> The VT100 emulation now also identifies itself as "XTERM" and
	      "VT100", in addition to the original "DEC-VT100" type.  The xterm
	      emulation should probably, at some point, be moved into a
	      separate class.
	  </ul>
      </dl>

      <h3>Changes in v1.2:</h3>
      <ul>
	<li> Added support for text styles.
      </ul>
	
      <h3>Changes in v1.1:</h3>
      <ul>
	<li> Added PROMPT#, REPLY#, and ENDPROMPT# arguments. 
      </ul>
