<A NAME="one"><H3>CAEN Model SY527 High Voltage System</H3>
(More information is here: <A HREF ="SY527.pdf">SY527 Manual </A>)<BR>
The System is organized into "crates"; each crate is a 19" wide, 8U high euro-mechanics rack.
The modules bearing the output channels (Channel Boards) consist of 6U plug-in modules
Up to 10 Channel Boards may be plugged into a single crate. Different plug-in modules are
available (Positive, Negative, Floating and Distributor Boards) and can be freely mixed in a
single System in order to obtain the necessary configuration.
<p>
Each crate may be controlled locally or remotely. Local control is performed manually through a
key-pad and an LCD display located on the Front Panel. Remote control is actuated by means
of a video terminal (ANSI VT100 or compatible) plugged into an RS232C connector, which is
also located on the Front Panel. In this case, a sophisticated Software User Interface is
available, featuring symbolic names for channels, custom status displays and other features
designed to help the management of a large number of channels. 
<p>
Each crate houses a HIGH SPEED (H. S.) CAENET node for the remote control; it allows the
possibility of linking one or more crates to a H. S. CAENET controller that acts as a System
Control Unit. Available controllers are
<ul>
<li> A303 H. S. CAENET IBMTM/PC Controller;
<li> C117B H. S. CAENET CAMAC Controller;
<li> V288 H. S. CAENET VME Controller.
</ul>
<p>
Alarms: On TRIP, OVERVOLTAGE, UNDERVOLTAGE, OVERTEMP.,
FAN FAILURE, and POWER FAILURE.
<p>
Restart at Power-On: Automatic after Power-On or Reset
Password protection: On each channel or group of channels

<h4>CHANNEL PARAMETERS</h4>
Several parameters are associated with each channel. They depend upon the Board type and
can be programmed and monitored in different ways:<br>
<ul>
<li> via Local control by using the LCD display and the Keypad;
<li> via Remote control through the H. S. CAENET link or through the RS232C Port;
<li> via the Front Panel input signals.
</ul>
<p>
The following is a brief description of the meaning of all parameters.
<p>
<ul>
<h5>CHANNEL NUMBER (Ch#)</h5>
It is the physical name of the channel (0.00, 0.01 and so on) and is determined by the channel
position;<br> this parameter is read out by the software and is always
associated to the channels monitored both in Local and Remote control.

<h5>CHANNEL NAME (Channel)</h5>
It is the symbolic name of the channel, it can be modified via Remote
Control; <br>
it may be up to 11 characters long and may contain any of the following characters:<br>
"0..9", "A..Z", "a..z", "#", "&", "%", "$", "*", "_" and "-".<br>
Via Local Control it is displayed but it is not possible to modify it.

<h5>VMAX HARDWARE (HVmax)</h5>
It is a hardware Voltage limit; usually it is fixed through a potentiometer.

<h5>VMAX SOFTWARE (SVmax)</h5>
It is the maximum Voltage value (in absolute value) programmable for the channel.<br>
It can be programmed either via Local or Remote Control.

<h5>V0SET (V0set)</h5>
It is the first of the two allowed Voltage programmable values (in absolute value).<br>
It is active when VSEL is FALSE. It can be programmed either via Local or Remote Control.

<h5>I0SET (I0set)</h5>
It is the first of the two allowed Current Limit programmable values (in absolute value)<br>.
It is active when ISEL is FALSE. It can be programmed either via Local or Remote Control.

<h5>V1SET (V1set)</h5>
It is the second of the two allowed Voltage programmable values (in absolute value).<br>
It is active when VSEL is TRUE. It can be programmed either via Local or Remote Control.

<h5>I1SET (I1set)</h5>
It is the second of the two allowed Current Limit programmable values (in absolute value).<br>
It is active when ISEL is TRUE. It can be programmed either via Local or Remote Control.

<h5>RAMP-UP (Rup)</h5>
Maximum Voltage programmable increase rate expressed in Volt/second (in absolute value).<br>
When a channel is switched On, or when it is switched from a lower Voltage value to a higher
one, the Voltage output drifts from one value to the other at the rate expressed by the Ramp-
Up parameter.
It can be programmed either via Local or Remote Control.

<h5>RAMP-DOWN (Rdwn)</h5>
Maximum Voltage programmable decrease rate expressed in Volt/second (in absolute value).<br>
When a channel is switched Off, or when is switched from a higher Voltage value to a lower
one, the Voltage output drifts from one value to the other at the rate expressed by the Ramp-
down parameter.<br>
The output voltage of a channel drops to zero following the Ramp-down parameter in these
cases:<br>
<ul>
<il> When the channel is switched Off (Power Parameter = Off);
<il> When the channel has tripped with 0< Trip parameter < 1000;
<il> When the channels' outputs are disabled via the "CH OUT EN" switch.
</ul>
It can be programmed either via Local or Remote Control.

<h5>VMON (Vmon)</h5>
Voltage Monitored value. It can be monitored either via Local or Remote Control.

<h5>IMON (Imon)</h5>
Current Monitored value.
It can be monitored either via Local or Remote Control.

<h5>TRIP (Trip)</h5>
It is the maximum time an "overcurrent" is allowed to last (expressed in tenths of second). If an
"overcurrent" lasts for more than the programmed value, the System will react in the following
ways:<br>
<ul>
<li>Trip =0..999: Ramp-down.<br>
	It will cause the channel to "Trip": after an interval of time equal to the Trip value
	in tenths of second, the output voltage will drop to zero at the rate specified by
	the Ramp-down parameter and the channel will be put in the Off state.
<li>
Trip = 1000: Constant Current.<br>
     The overcurrent may last indefinitely. If the Board has programmable current
     hardware protections, the channel behaves like a current generator.
     It can be programmed either via Local or Remote Control.
</ul>

<h5>POWER (Pw)</h5>
It is the On/Off Status of the channel; by setting this parameter On the channel is On and the
output drifts from 0 to the programmed value at the programmed rate (if the interlock is not
active and the CH OUT ENABLE switch is in the Enable position). Via Terminal it is controlled
by the Password Protection (see 'Password protection' ' and 'On/Off protection''').
It can be programmed either via Local or Remote Control.

<h5>PRIORITY ON/OFF (PrOn/PrOff)</h5>
These parameters are active only via Terminal control in the Group operation. The
Priority On/Off of the channels in a Group allows to switch On or Off the channels with a
determined sequence in order to obtain the safest ON/OFF procedure.<br>
<ul>
<li>Priority On/Off = 0: The channel status is not affected by the Group ON/OFF command.

<li>Priority On/Off = 1..16: The channel status is affected by the Group ON/OFF command 
                    in such a way that channels  with higher priority are switched ON/OFF before
                    channels with lower priority.
</ul>

<h5>POWER-ON ENABLE (Pon)</h5>
This parameter controls the behavior of the channel at Power-On (On/Off).<br> 
If this parameter is On, the channel reacts at Power-On, or after a
Restart, restoring the same value of the Power parameter at the time
of the Power-Off or the Reset occurrence.<br>
All the channels with this parameter On are switched On following the sequence of priorities
defined in GROUP00.
If the Power-On Status is Off, at Power-On or after a Reset the channel is Off regardless of its
status before the Power-Off or the Reset occurrence.<br>
It can be programmed either via Local or Remote Control.

<h5>CHANNEL STATUS (Status)</h5>
It is the status of the channel that can be:<br>
<ul>
<li>Up:<br> Voltage Output Up.<br>
   The voltage is regularly increasing towards the programmed value at the
   programmed rate (Ramp-Up).<p>

<li>Down:<br> Voltage Output Down.<br>
    The voltage is regularly decreasing towards the programmed value at the
    programmed rate (Ramp-Down).<p>

<li>Ovv:<br> Overvoltage.<br>
    This condition is signalled:
    When the actual value of the voltage output is higher than the programmed
    value;<br>
    When the actual value of the voltage increase/decrease rate is higher then
    the programmed value (Ramp-Up /Ramp-Down parameter).
    If the Ovv mask is ON (see § 3.4.9) the output signal CH STATUS becomes true.<p>

<li>Unv:<br> Undervoltage.<br>
     This condition is signalled:
     When the actual value of the voltage output is lower than the programmed
     value;<br>
     When the actual value of the voltage increase/decrease rate is lower than
     the programmed value (Ramp-up/Ramp-down parameter).
     If the Unv mask is ON (see § 3.4.9) the output signal CH STATUS becomes true.<p>

<li>Ovc:<br> Overcurrent.<br>
    The current limit has been reached, and if the Board has a programmable
    current hardware protection the channel is behaving like a constant current
    source. If the Ovc mask is ON (see § 3.4.9) the output signal CH STATUS becomes true.<p>

<li>Trip-down:<br> The channel has tripped.<br>
          An overcurrent has lasted for an interval longer than the allowed time and the
         voltage is decreasing towards 0 at the programmed rate (Ramp-Down).<p>

<li>Tripped:<br> The channel has tripped and has been switched off.<br>
      	 If the CH STATUS is true, it remains in this state until a "Clear Alarm" command
       	 is performed (see § 5.1). To recover from this state it is sufficient to turn that
       	 channel On again. This operation also clears the CH STATUS signal (if asserted).<p>

<li>Vmax.<br> The channel has reached the Vmax Hardware value.<br>
      This means that the hardware protection circuit is active.
      The Channel Status can be monitored either via Local or Remote Control.<p>
</ul>

<h5>PASSWORD PROTECTION STATUS (Pswd)</h5>
This protection is active only via Terminal control if the Password is Enabled.<br> 
It is the status of the protection: if this status is "Required" it is
necessary to know the password to
modify the parameters of the channel (see the following paragraph for a complete description
of the protections).
It can be programmed via Remote Control; <br>

<h5>ON/OFF PROTECTION STATUS (On/Off)</h5>
This protection is active only via Terminal control.<br> In conjunction with the Password
Protection Status, it determines the possible channel operations.
If the Password is disabled it is possible to modify every value of the Channel Parameters
regardless of its Password Parameter.
</ul>


<A NAME="two"><h3>Notes for CAEN A932A board</h3>
CAEN A932A board is currently used in CAEN crates.<br>
(More informtion is here: <A HREF="a9xx_rev0.pdf">MODELS SY527
	DISTRIBUTOR BOARDS </A> )<br>
<p>
The Board houses a Primary High Voltage Channel and 24 Active Distributor Output
Channels, directly supplied by the Primary Channel.
<p>
The Voltage on each Distributed Output Channel (V_SET) can be independently programmed
in a range of 900 V drop from the Primary Channel V_PRIM setting with a Current of 0.5 mA
on each Distributed Channel.
<p>
All these 25 channels appear both on the GUI display and on the RS232 Terminal. 
The 24 distributed channels are numbered from 0 to 23, 
while the primary H.V. channel appears as number 24.
<p>
In order to obtain the desired specifications, 
the difference between the primary channel voltage setting and the
distributors output voltage setting is between 50 V and 900 V 
with a load drawing more than 200 uA
<p>
<b>A suggested operation procedure for a Power-On of all channels could be the following:</b><br>
<ol>
<li> Program the 24 distributed channels at the desired voltage set, taking care that the
maximum difference between the 24 settings does not exceed 900 V.
<li> Program the primary channel at a setting = [max. setting of distributed channels + 50V].
<li> Set all channels ON simultaneously (in common operation).
</ol>
<p>
 Even if all distributed channels are set to OFF via terminal, H. S. CAENET or
 via front panel keyboard, this does NOT imply that there is no output voltage on
 the Multipin connectors.
<p>
<b>For the A932A board, "Channel OFF" means that the A932A distributed channel
supplies as output a voltage that is equal to the primary channel voltage minus the
maximum drop (approx. 900 V).<br> 
As an example, if the primary channel is set to 2200 V and the
distributed channel is set to 1900 V, if the distributor channel is ON
the output on the multipin connectors will be 1900 V with ≤5 mV ripple, while if the
distributor channel is OFF the output on the multipin connectors will be approx.
1300 V with a higher ripple.</b>

<A NAME="three"><h3>HV Control System</h3>
HV control system consists of two High Voltage CAEN crates, CaeNet VME
  board V288, 
VME crate with a single
board computer (VxWorks, CPU-MVME2306).
HV crates are connected to V288 board using CAENET network with daisy-chain schema. 
The server, which runs on VME computer, translates commands from HV GUI
  to control CAEN crates and sends back responses from CAEN modules
  using HV GUI protocol. 
The communication protocol between HV GUI and server is TCP/IP (it is the same
  as used for LeCroy-1458 HV System).

<h4>More Details</h4>
HV GUI monitors changes of channel parameters(properties) by polling summary
numbers from server using commands: <b>"GS", "LS", "PS".</b><br>
There are 3 types of summary numbers:
<ul> 
<li>  global:   GS - five four-digits words(hex),
<li>  logical:  LS - two four-digit word(hex) for every module(slot),
<li>  property: PS - one four-digit word(hex) for every hv channel
  property(parameter).
</ul><br>
If channel property is changed, PS number for that property is incremented,
then LS number for corresponded module(board) is incremented and then
GS number is also incremented.
GUI gets these changed summary numbers and it founds what property in what module(board)
have to be updated, then it sends recall command to server with corresponded
parameter name.<br>
<p>
Task called 'monitor' runs on VME computer and it scans all hv
channels in loop  by crates, boards  to readout
parameters values.
Values from all hv channels are stored in monitor's memory
(arrays). Stored values are updated in regular time interval (about
10-15 sec for one crate with 10 boards).
Property value after readout from HV channel is compared with corresponded value stored in array.
If there is some(predefined) difference between these two values, 
summary number for that property is incremented.<br>
Server receives recall command from GUI for corresponded property and
sends back property value stored in 'monitor' array.

<A NAME="four"><h3>Start HV GUI</h3>
HV GUI is located on <b>'hvsrv3'</b> computer under <b>'highv'</b> account in directory <b>/home/highv/slowc.</b><br>
There is test configuration in directory /home/highv/slowc/TEST.<br> 
Host names for CAEN crates in HV GUI:<br>  
<ul>
<li>       Crate #12:<b> sbscdet:2012 </b>
<li>       Crate #9 :<b> sbscdet:2009 </b>
</ul>
<p>
To start HV GUI:
<ul>
<li>  Login to 'hvsrv3' as user 'highv' (password is the same as for 'adaq').<br>
<li>  Go to directory slowc: 
<i>cd slowc</i><br>
<li> Start GUI: 
<i>./hvs TEST</i>
</ul>
<p>
Initialization time of two HV crates in GUI is about 2 min. Update
time for changed parameter in one crate is about 10-15 sec. Be patient, it takes time.

<h4>HV GUI Power ON/OFF button</h4>
CAEN SY527 crate does not support direct remote command to switch power ON or OFF for entire crate.
There is only On/OFF option for every channel.<br> 
HV GUI Power ON button will not provide any power action. It is used only to clear alarm state ("CH STATUS" output on the front panel of the crate).<br>
HV GUI Power OFF button is used to immediate switch OFF  all channels in crate(s).<br>
Power ON/OFF for one channel is provided by enabling/disabling channel property "CE_Ch".<br>
There is group GUI command in "Menu->Edit" to Enable/Disable all channels in module, crate or all crates.

<h4>HV GUI Voltage Polarity </h4>
CAEN SY527 boards does not support polariy property.<br> 
HV GUI will accept only positive values for settable parameters regardless of board polarity.
